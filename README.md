🔭 I’m currently working on **Manzo Solutions™** – a freelancing startup delivering web apps, poster designs, UI prototypes, and media editing services.
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source tools, educational platforms, or anything that empowers students and freelancers.

🌱 I’m currently learning advnced frontend development (React + Tailwind), Firebase integrations, and smart automation for web apps.
💬 Ask me about frontend UI/UX design, web app architecture, Firebase workflows, or startup building as a student.
